# IZ-Skin

Allows clients to select from a number of saved appearances (skins) from a client script using basic text commands.

The purpose of this program is to make it easier to convert saved data from TrainerV, a popular trainer program. The result is the ability to load skins through a much simpler and faster interface, ideal for servers that do not allow scripthook.

The server host can adjust the preset appearances.

Features:
- The script copies the selected array of skin properties from the saved arrays
- Works with custom MP skins including hair, face blend, skin tone, overlays (such as facial hair), and eye color.
